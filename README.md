## What is an Interactive Story Game?
##### An Interactive Story Game is a text based adventure where you have choices that will affect the outcome of the story. Interactive Story Games became popular in the 1970s. It was a simpler way of creating a game without having to use moving graphics. Instead the game was text based and you could influence the story to reach multiple endings.
