# Python Interactive Story Project
 This class project will take you through a text based adventure with a fight to the death at the end!
## What is an Interactive Story Game?
  An Interactive Story Game is a text based adventure where you have choices that will affect the outcome of the story. Interactive Story Games became popular in the 1970s. It was a simpler way of creating a game without having to use moving graphics. Instead the game was text based and you could influence the story to reach multiple endings.
## How do you play this Interactive Story Game?
 The main point of this Interactive Story Game is that you will be given options and choices to make throughout the game.
 1. First, you will go through the story of the game.
  * The game will provide you with options to choose from.
  * The game will then prompt you to chose an option and the story will follow that specific path.
  * Keep in mind that there are dead ends that will require you to restart the game, so be careful on which option you choose!
