Interactive story for my python programming class.
# Python Interactive Story Project
 This class project will take you through a text based adventure with a fight to the death at the end!
## What is an Interactive Story Game?
  An Interactive Story Game is a text based adventure where you have choices that will affect the outcome of the story. Interactive Story Games became popular in the 1970s. It was a simpler way of creating a game without having to use moving graphics. Instead the game was text based and you could influence the story to reach multiple endings.
## How do you play this Interactive Story Game?
 The main point of this Interactive Story Game is that you will be given options and choices to make throughout the game.
 1. First, you will go through the story of the game.
  * The game will provide you with options to choose from.
  * The game will then prompt you to chose an option and the story will follow that specific path.
  * For whichever path you choose, the story will give you different items.
  * Keep in mind that there are dead ends that will require you to restart the game, so be careful on which option you choose!
 2. Second, there will be a fight at the end of the game! There will be two options you can make while fighting.
  * Attack: This will ensure that both you and the boss take damage, how much damage will depend on how much armor and what kind of weapon you have.
  * Dodge: This will give you a 75% chance to successfully dodge the boss's attack. If you have a successful dodge, the boss will miss and strike himself for 2 health.
## What if you type something other than the given options?
 The game will break.
## Is there any required software instalation to play?
 Other than a version of Python 2.7, you will not have to download and install anything to play this game.
